Based on my achievement of ranking in the top 5 out of 110 students based on my scores, as well as my research experience during my undergraduate studies, I was granted direct admission to BJTU without having to take the postgraduate examination. This opportunity is only given to a select few undergraduates each year from thousands of universities across the country.

# Research experience
## Research on Key Technologies of Data Governance and Trusted Interaction                      2022.07 – 2023.06
  * I proposed a distributed authentication scheme to address the problem of unauthorized access in decentralized data sharing and promote secure and privacy-friendly data sharing.
  * I proposed an incentive mechanism to further facilitate the circulation and utilization of multi-source heterogeneous data while ensuring supervision and privacy protection.

## Research on Security Protection Technology of Muti-access Edge Computing (MEC) Network       2021.09-2022.06
  * I proposed a mutual authentication and authorization scheme for MEC-based smart healthcare systems, which extends OAuth 2.0. The security of this mechanism has been formally proven by BAN logic.
  * I proposed a Single Sign-On authentication mechanism that enables seamless mobility across multiple MEC platforms. This mechanism allows for access status recovery via tokens and has been formally proven to be secure and correct by the Sequence of Games method.

## Research on Industrial Internet of Things Technologies, Standards, and Authentication        2021.04-2021.08
  * I conducted an investigation into the characteristics of the edge, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers in the industrial Internet of Things platform. As a result, I completed a research report on cryptographic primitives that are suitable for identity authentication technologies within this framework.
  * I conducted a survey on the research status and relevant standards of cross-domain identity management and authentication technologies at both domestic and international levels. This survey aimed to examine the current state of these technologies and the associated standards.

## Research on Imprecision Analysis of Network Access Control Intention                         2020.07-2021.01
  * Within a project focused on network access control policies, our team's primary focus was on deducing conflicts while considering knowledge uncertainty. I played a key role in enhancing the efficiency of processing large-scale OWL semantics and reasoning algorithms.

# Interests & Hobbies

To manage stress and balance my workload, I incorporate various activities into my daily routine:
* During my role as a study secretary, I received the Excellent Student Cadre designation for my outstanding work.
* In 2019, I organized a summer social practice team on behalf of HBU. Our objective was to investigate the development of old-age care and education in Laishui County. As a result of our efforts, I was recognized as an Advanced Individual in Social Work.
* In my leisure time, I find enjoyment in activities such as reading, singing, and participating in outdoor activities like hiking or sports.
