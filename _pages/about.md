I am a graduate from the [School of Computer and Information Technology](https://scit.bjtu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), having completed my Master's degree in Computer Technology in 2023. My research interests encompass cryptography, distributed systems, network security, and blockchain. I am currently actively seeking opportunities for a doctoral position to further delve into and contribute to these areas.

During my Master's program, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Xiaolin Chang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8026/), affiliated with the Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). My research primarily focused on the design and analysis of security protocols.
